## Low diversity

It's not recommended to sequence low plex AbSeq alone in a lane.

## Loading concentration

## Dual index

Customers need to order additional index and primers. Index and primers go hand in hand?

8 lanes: Customers can order 4 i7 and do single index

The diversity of the index also follows the rule. Low diversity leads to low sequencing quality in index.

Reverse Primer 1 - 4: Name is Nextera, but the backbone is TrueSeq. So, it's important to use TrueSeq chemistry.
