## Interaction with FlowJo

This publication provide a workflow to export single cell data as a FCS and then import it into FlowJo for gating.

<https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cpz1.963>

Consider:

1.  Normalization is performed with Seurat but not with FlowJo.

    Single cell data requires different normalization methods.

    \- Experimental workflows are different.

    \- Flow data uses compensation to correct for background noise.
